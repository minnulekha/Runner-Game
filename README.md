# Runner-Game
This is a simple **infinite runner game** prototype built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where a player (blue box) can jump over the ground using the spacebar. It demonstrates basic game mechanics like gravity, jumping, and canvas rendering â€” a solid starting point for building a Dino Runner or Subway Surfer-style game.
